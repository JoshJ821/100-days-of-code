# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 23, 2021


**Today's Progress**: decided to try #100DaysOfCode, forked something on GitHub for the first time ever 

**Thoughts:** excited to try to double down on learning. Goal is to continue FCC with js and start Python course. FCC Python course was not my style, have started Angela Yu's Udemy course instead as it is more varied and heavily focused on projects
