# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 23, 2021


**Today's Progress**: decided to try #100DaysOfCode, forked something on GitHub for the first time ever 

**Thoughts:** excited to try to double down on learning. Goal is to continue FCC with js and start Python course. FCC Python course was not my style, have started Angela Yu's Udemy course instead as it is more varied and heavily focused on projects

### Day 2: February 24, 2021


**Today's Progress**: Continued Python course, started working on manipulating strings, vars, and inputs. Made v1 of Bart Quotes
**Thoughts:** Python has the advantages I liked in Swift w. high level language syntax w/o dealing w. xCode for learning
